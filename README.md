# üëã Welcome to EaglerXProxy - No Replit, No paid

{% hint style="info" %}
**A project that iamwinix has made. This has been around when Eaglercraft 1.8.8 has been released but no one has not known how to do it until Winix.**
{% endhint %}

Here are the directions if the video is blocked by your school.

> Make a Bungeecord server. Import Bungeecord.jar. How to get this is from google. Type in bungeecord and find a website that is up to date for it.

> Next, start your bungeecord server. then go to files/plugins then import EaglerXBungee. To get this go to https://eaglercraft.com then go yo downloads. Once you have done that go to plugins, import it. After that restart your server.

Go to files plugins/EaglercraftXBungee/Listeners.yml and go to address on line 2 and remove the auto generated port and put your own bungeecord port.&#x20;

Go to spigot.yml then go to line 16 to bungeecord, and set that to true, save the file.

Go to config.yml to change your server address to any such as a hub. Go to line 20, then change it to your paper or any egg host you have. Save the file, restart your server and kill it, start it back up. Then type in your bungeecord ip in your web browser of your choice. You will see a webstock 404 error. Once you see a gray box says ws://localhost:25565 (this is ony an example you will see your own domain) Copy that and go to eaglercraft and copy it as a server address. You must have it ws not wss. Keep the port 25565 to your pwn port in Eaglercraft.

How to fix ‚Äúyour not registered to this server.‚Äù

Go to bungeecord and go to config.yml then line 17 once you see ‚Äúonline-mode = true‚Äù Set that to false you will see it like ‚Äúonline-mode = false‚Äù Restart your bungeecord.
